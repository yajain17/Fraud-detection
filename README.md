# Fraud-detection
Our Goals: DETERMINE WHETHER A TRANSACTION IS FRAUD OR NOT Understand the little distribution of the "little" data that was provided to us. Create a 50/50 sub-dataframe ratio of "Fraud" and "Non-Fraud" transactions. Determine the Classifiers we are going to use and decide which one has a higher accuracy.
